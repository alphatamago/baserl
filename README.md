This is Python code I wrote while reading the book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction", 2nd edition, by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.

My goal in writing this code was to try the algorithms I learn from the book by reproducing some of the exercises in the book.

I pulled the common code and algorithms in regular Python files organized as a library, while the actual exercises are written in Jupyter notebooks which import the common code.
